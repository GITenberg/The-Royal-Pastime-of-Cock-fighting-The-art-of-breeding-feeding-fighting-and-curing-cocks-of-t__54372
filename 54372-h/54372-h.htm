</div>
<p class="drop-cap drop-letter">I&nbsp;Presume I need not here insist
upon the long acquaintance, and friendship that has passed betwixt
us, to press you to the Patronage of this little BOOK, when there
are so many other considerations that in a manner force it upon you,
as having a certain right to it; <i>Cocking</i> being not only to you a
hereditary Divertisment, which for many Ages together has by your
Valiant Ancestors been carefully handed down to their Posterity,
with marks of the greatest love and Honour imaginable, as when your
loyal Grand-father lay Bleeding and Dying on his Turfey Beed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
was thus (like a good Subject) heard to say, <i>My King and a good
Cock I ever loved, and like a good Cock in my dread Sovereign’s service
I shall now expire.</i></p>

<p>Also your Prudent Father and both your Uncles from their Infancy were
great admirers of the Noble <i>Science</i> of Cocking.</p>

<p>And you your self in the Morning of your Days, took to the Royal Sport,
and closely followed it for many Years: even till mighty <i>William</i>
call’d you forth to signalize your Vallor in the Bloody Irish Fields of
<i>Athlone</i>, and <i>Cannough</i>, where you cut through the Squadrons
of the affrighted French, and made the Howling <i>Teagues</i> fly to
the Boggs for shelter.</p>

<p>And after this, you in the very depth of Winter, crost those dangerous
<i>Atlantic</i> Seas, came home, and with your Friends and Tenants your
good Neighbours, and old Acquaintance that flocked about you to your
Mannor-house, where you a noble Christmas kept, the Rich you highly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
treated, and the Poor were daily at your Gates relieved: each Rank
according to their Quality you kindly entertained; till Spring
approaching, and the rude allarms of War once more required you to take
up Arms and fit your self for <i>Flanders</i>.</p>

<p>A Fatal Pit to many a Gallant Cock, a Bloody Spot of Ireful Ground, on
which the fierce <i>Bellona’s</i> Shambles stands: Hither you early came
prepared for Fight, and first at <i>Charleroy</i> you dy’d your Sword in
Gallic Blood, and with your Flaming Blade, cut your own way straight to
<i>Gemblours</i>, from whence to <i>Charlemont</i> you forced the <i>French</i> to Fly.</p>

<p>And last of all before <i>Namure</i>; what mighty Vallour did you there
display? a Limb you lost, yet limping still Fought on, and charged as
unconcern’d as if you had had no Wound upon you, untill his Majesty was
Pleased to give particuler orders to have you brought off, and sent to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
<i>Bredah</i>, where long you lay under the Surgeon’s Hands e’er you
obtained a Cure: after which Winter coming on, the Camp broke up, and
the Armies on both sides were sent to their Winter-quarters, and his
Majesty King <i>William</i> returned to the <i>Hague</i> where you at last
also arrived with Crutches, and there laid down your Arms, kiss’d the King’s
Hand, and had a good Place at Court conferred upon you in the room of
your Commission.</p>

<p>So that now you only wait at certain times, for which you are well
rewarded, and have the Liberty of retiring to your Pleasant Country
Seat, where now you spend most of your time amongst your Friends, and
old Acquaintance, and reap the Comforts of a rural life, amidst two or
three Loyal toping Souls, many good Cocks, and rich <i>October</i> Liquor:
with which you oft times guild the good old Doctor’s Nose, and raise
the Pious Preachers Voice six Notes higher in the Afternoon, than in the Morning.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span></p>

<p>For though you daily take your Bottle, and Cock, as long as the Season
lasts, yet you ne’er fail to attend the Man of God, when Sunday comes,
early you to the Temple Ride, and there before the Alter offer up your
Orizons with all the fervency immaginable, and in the Afternoon, when
by the Sexton call’d, you bring the Priest back in your Coach well
refreshed by a good Dinner, and a cheerful grace-cup after it, which
enables him to perform Evening service briskly, and with a Laudable
Voice pronounce a Blessing on you when the Vesper’s over.</p>

<p>Nor do your Tennants and poor Neighbours fail to pray for your long
Life, and good success in Cocking, the only Sport you take delight
in: And to speak Truth, you may really be said to be the only person
of this present Age, that Practises <i>Cocking</i> rightly, and follows it
purely for the end it was at first intended.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>

<p>And therefore it was truly that I thought there was no Person so fit as
you, to be the Patron of this ensuing Treatise; wherein I have not only
made common to the World the many and different ways of <i>Breeding</i>,
<i>Feeding</i>, and <i>Fighting</i> both of the great, or Game Cock (as we call
them) and of the little Match-Cock also, with the several Diseases
incident to them, and the most approved Medicines that are now made
use of, both to prevent, and cure each Mallady, and that by the ablest
Cock-masters at this Day in the known World.</p>

<p>I have also proved Cocking to be both Ancient and Honourable, and to
the present Age (if rightly made use of) greatly profitable, and have
plainly laid open the Malice and Ignorance of all such as endeavour to
villify, and bespatter it, shewing the Weakness of their Arguments, and
the true Motives that engage them to speak against Cocking.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<p>And though some may think me too Copious in Etimologizing upon the
right end, and use of this most Ancient and Honourable Exercise of
Cocking, whilst others no less blame me for exposing to Plebeian view,
those Misteries in Breeding, and Dieting, which commonly cost young
Gamsters so dear, e’er they arrive at the true knowledge of.</p>

<p>But to pass by such as these, and give the World to understand that I
have no other end in Publishing this ensuing Treatise, but meerly, and
purely to promote the Noble and most Heroic Exercise of Cocking: And at
the same time to acknowledge my self, most Worthy Sir, your Worship’s
most Real, and most faithful Friend, and Fellow Cocker</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap"><i>How happy were those Sons of Men,
who in times past were reputed Persons indued with that noble Gift</i>,
aut facere scribenda, aut scribere legenda, <i>that is, either to do
such things as deserved to be writ, or to write that which was worth
the reading: Now that this ensuing Treatise is worth the reading, and
practising too, notwithstanding the little Esteem and Value, that
the present Age affords it, I shall endeavour to prove both from the
great Antiquity, and Usefulness of this noble Sport of Cocking: A
thing esteem’d so Sacred, and held in such high Veneration amongst the
Antients, that, as</i> Diodorus Siculus <i>testifies, the Fighting-Cock was
reckon’d one of the principal Gods worshiped by the</i> Syrians.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">Diodor. Sicul. <i>lib.</i> 1. 18. R. Da. non diffentit.</div>

<div class="sidenote_l">Athenæ. Diosco. <i>lib.</i> 4.</div>

<p><i>And</i> Rabby David, <i>a learned Hebrew Doctor, interpreting the</i> 2 <i>of</i>
Kings ch. 17. v. 30, 31. <i>where</i> Nergal <i>is spoken, of which is (as
he says) a Cock of the Field, a Champion Cock, a Cock for War, or a
Fighting Cock, and by them there Worshiped as a God in</i> Samaria. <i>Which
at once denotes the high Esteem and Value, with the great Antiquity
also, of these Warlike Birds. And</i> Athenæus <i>and</i> Dioscorides, <i>both of
them acknowledge the Fighting-Cock to be one of the Deities which the
antient</i> Greeks <i>did greatly Adore. And that in their time there was an
Altar found in a Vault far under Ground, whereon had been engraven’d a
Cock, and inscribed thus</i></p>

<p class="f110">DEO MOUNO.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">Macro. <i>lib.</i> 1. c. 31.</div>

<p><i>Which, as</i> Macrobius <i>also affirms, signifies One, or Only; and this
Attribute they gave to the Cock, because he was the greatest, and
almost the only Deity they Ador’d, the rest being accounted but his
Assistants, and Coadjutors.</i></p>

<p><i>And</i> Pliny <i>in the tenth Book of his Natural History, sufficiently
sets forth at large, the high and mighty Value and Respect that the
antient Romans bore towards Fighting-Cocks, says he there</i>:</p>

<div class="sidenote_r">Plin. <i>chap.</i> 21.</div>

<p>These Birds about our Houses are our Centinels by Night, Nature has
Created them to awaken and call Men up to do their Work; they have also
a Sence and Understanding of Glory: Moreover, they are Astronomers, and
know the Course of the Stars, they divide the Day by their Crowing,
from three Hours to three Hours; when the Sun goes to Rest, they go to
Roost: And like Centinels, they keep the Relief of the Fourth Watch;
in the Camp they call Men up to their careful Labour and Travel: They
will not suffer the Sun to rise and steal upon us, but they give us
warning of it: By their Crowing, they tell us the Day is coming, and
they foretel their Crowing likewise, by clapping their Sides with their
Wings. Ye shall see them to march Stately, carrying their Neck bolt
upright, with a Comb on their Heads, like the Crest of a Soldiers
Helmet; and there is not a Bird besides himself that so oft looketh
aloft to the Sun and Sky; and hereupon it is that marching thus
Proudly as they do, the very Lyons (which of all wild Beasts be most
Couragious) stand in Fear and Awe of them, and will not abide the sight of them.</p>

<p><i>So that hence may be inferred the great Use and Benefit that the
Romans made of these vigilant Astronomical Monitors; Experience
plainly taught them, what would be difficult to make some now-a-days
to believe, Namely, that the Fighting-Cock is a Bird in himself both
useful and profitable, as I shall prove more fully anon, to the
silencing of all those whom Ignorance prompts to say any thing against
it, for you know the abuse of a thing should not take away the right
use of it; and if so, I don’t doubt but to clear the Point, against any
one that shall oppose me herein; but before I leave this
famous Philosopher, see here what</i> Plinie <i>yet farther says of
Fighting-Cocks</i>: —They are great Commanders, <i>says he</i>, and Rulers,
and are made for War and Fighting; and the Countries from whence they
first came, are grown into Name, being much renowned for their Breed,
as namely, <i>Tenagra</i> and <i>Rhodus</i> in the first and highest Degree: in
a second rank and place, be those of <i>Melos</i> and <i>Chalcis</i>. And unto
these Birds (for their Worth and Dignity) the Purple Robe at <i>Rome</i>,
and all Magistrates of State disdain not to give Honour. These rule
our great Rulers every Day: And there is not a mighty Lord or State
of <i>Rome</i>, that dare open or shut the Door of his House, before he
knows the good Pleasure of these Fowles: And that which is more, the
Soveraign Magistrate in his Majestie of the Roman Empire, with the
regal Ensigns of Rods and Axes, carried before him, neither sets he
forward, nor reculeth back, without Direction from these Birds; they
give order to whole Armies to Advance forth to Battle, and again
command them to stay and keep within the Camp.</p>

<p>These were they (<i>says</i> Plinie) that gave the Signal, and foretold
the issue of all those Famous Foughten Fields, whereby we have Atchieved
all our Victories throughout the whole World: In one Word, these Birds
command those Great Commanders of all Nations upon the Earth.</p>

<p>Their Crowing out of Order too soon before their Hour, or too late,
portendeth also, and presageth something remarkable, for well
known it is, that by their Crowing at one time all Night long, they
foresignified to the <i>Bœotians</i>, that noble Victory of theirs
atchieved over the <i>Lacedemonians</i>. For this Interpretation, and
Conjecture was given thereupon of a Fortunate Day (<i>says</i> Plinie)
because that Bird never Croweth if he be Beaten or Overcome.</p>

<p>And at <i>Pergamus</i> every Year there is a solemn shew, exhibited openly
to the People, of Cock-Fighting, as if Sword-Fencers were brought
within the Lists to Fight at Outterance.</p>

<div class="sidenote_r">Vid. Pur. Pil. cap. 16. pag. 329.</div>

<p><i>And</i> Strabo, <i>in</i> Purchases <i>Pilgrimage, extolling the Great and Royal
exercise of Cocking, whence so many Benefits accrue to Mankind, if well
observed, says also, that at</i> Pergamus <i>there was yearly Spectacles
of Cock-Fighting offered where the Princes, Nobles and Gentlemen
both old and young were sure to be, for as much as from hence they
gathered not only and barely Courage and Audacity: But also did see the
great necessity of a firm unshaken Resolution, with Perseverance and
Stability of mind, even to the last Minute: So that by the Example of
these unparallel’d Birds, the People in those Days were extimulated and
spurred on to Great and Generous Enterprizes.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote_r">Vid. Melon. lib. 2. cap. 9.</div>

<p><i>Nor did the</i> Roman Empire <i>shrink so long as Cocking was esteem’d in</i>
Rome. <i>And ’tis reported of that Subtle, and most Victorious Emperor</i>
Severus, <i>that when he was determin’d to Conquer</i> (<i>if possible</i>) Great
Britain, <i>that to draw off his two Sons</i> Antonine <i>and</i> Geta, <i>from
the Bewitching Vanities of the Theatre, and to prepare them in Mind
the better to bear the many difficulties and hardships, that they
must of Necessity undergo in the Prosecution of so great and bloody
an Enterprize, as the subduing even</i> Thule <i> itself, which was then
deemed the utmost Region of the</i> North; <i>he commands the Sport of
Cock-Fighting, to be exhibited Dayly before his Sons, and the principal
Officers of his Army, and that not only to make them emulous of Glory
through the Performance of great Atchievements, but also to be firm and
unshaken in the midst of Dangers, nay in Death itself.</i></p>

<p><i>And really were Cocking now-a-days exhibited to the People of this
present Age wherein we live, by the supream Powers and Potentates of
the World, for political ends. And certain Orators appointed at the
same time to Comment thereupon, and in florid Speeches, Ductarious to
War, and Marshal Exercises, and insinuating into the People the great
magnanimous Temper and Disposition of these Heroic Birds, with variety
of Inferences drawn from particular Passages and the great Essays that
they discover to a judicious Eye, in their way and manner of Fighting.
I Question not but Cocking would now produce as good Effects as then it
did, and influence the</i> British <i>Valour to greater Things, than ever</i>
Roman <i>Courage yet dared to Attempt.</i></p>

<p><i>Some Instances of this Practice, the Ingenious</i> Nocoli-di-Conti <i>has
given in his History of</i> Sumatra. <i>This Kingdom is not only one of the
greatest, but is also the most esteemed of all the Eastern Islands,
insomuch that the Indians call it</i> Tenarisem, <i>or the delicious Land.</i></p>

<p><i>And for the Inhabitants, if we may credit, not only</i> Di-Conti, <i>but
also Sir</i> Ed. Michelborne <i>and Sir</i> James Lancaster, <i>Men of Renown
in Queen</i> Elizabeth<i>’s Days, and Famed for their Valour and great
Integrity; these Knights, both of them, averr the</i> Sumatrans <i>to be
a People truly Valiant and Magnanimous, and not only more Subtle
and Politic, but also much more Just and Honest than any other of
the</i> Indians <i>whatsoever.</i></p>

<p><i>None so much loved and courted, none so much by Enemies feared and
dreaded, throughout all the</i> East, <i>as</i> Sumatrans: <i>where particular
care is taken for the promotion of Cocking; for they annex stately
Buildings to their Fanes and Temples, where they keep at public Charge,
divers Fighting Cocks, which are brought forth, as the People come to
Worship, and are fought in a spacious Court Eastward, on the Right-Hand
of the Door of the House of their Gods: after which a certain Priest
skilled in Cocking, and approved for his great Ability in Astronomy,
and all natural Philosophy, having a voluble ready way of speaking,
first takes up the conquering Cock, after the Battle is over, and
presents him to their Deities, and then comes and takes up the slain
Cock, and puts him into a Golden Cauldron, where he bathes his bloody
Limbs in Sankereen; and then, with rich Gums and Spices, burns his Body
upon an Altar made for that purpose; after which his Ashes are put
carefully up in a Golden Pot, or Urn, there to remain for ever: And
then the</i> Brammen, <i>or Priest makes a long Speech to the People,
shewing the Excellency of Cocking, and the great Use and Benefit of
it to all such as know how rightly to apply it, and Expatiates much
upon the present Combate, drawing divers Inferences from the various
passages and Transactions made use of by the late Foughten Cocks,
shewing also the great Magnanimity, Courage, Skill, and Constancy of
these Warriours.</i></p>

<p><i>And lastly, he applies it so Pertinently to all that are present,
in Terms so fit and suitable, that it conduces greatly to their
Edification, grounding in them a firm and stable temper of Mind, with
an unshaken Valour, whereby they are now truly said to be a People
Invincible; And verily I am of Opinion, that from hence at first came
that Saying so common amongst us still</i>, viz. He is gone to Church to
see a Cock-Fight: <i>And at this Day there are divers Places up in the</i>
East <i>where Cocking is accounted a thing Sacred, and in great Use
amongst them, as</i> Magellan <i>assures us.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote_l">Isac. Pontac. <i>see</i>.</div>

<p><i>For, says he, both in</i> Borneo, Calegan, <i>and</i> Pulaoan, <i>Cocks for the
Game are kept, and are of Sacred use amongst them, but eat not of their
Flesh, that being forbidden by the</i> Bramens, <i>or Priests.</i></p>

<p><i>That great Man, the highly Celebrated</i> Selden <i>observes Cocking to
be a thing of great Use, and much admir’d by rising Marshal Men, who
with keen Swords cut out good Fortune to themselves, from the doubtful
Loyns of Fate. And there is not a surer sign of a Nations or Peoples
degenerating into effeminacy, and so consequently falling into Poverty
and utter Ruin, than when they totally change the Warlike Exercise of
Cocking for mimical Plays, silly Dancing, and such like Fopperies.</i>
Rome <i>itself was a sad Instance of the Truth of this, when the proud</i>
Eagle <i>stripd off all her Gaudy Plumes, lay naked and expos’d to the
Rage, and Fury of the depopulating</i> Goths <i>and</i> Vandals.</p>

<p>Gustavus Adolphus, <i>when he came to rescue the then King of</i> Denmark,
<i>out of the</i> Tallons <i>of</i> German <i>Power, told the distressed Prince,
that he had now nothing to fear, since he was well assured that the
Imperialists had given up the Gantlet, and had nothing left but a
fringed Glove for their Guard, for instead of Cock-Fighting (says he)
and Martial Exercise, they seem wholly to be devoted, and given up to
Effeminate Dancing, and inervating Drunkenness, two Infallible Signs
of a sinking People, as that Warlike King full well observed and after
with his Sword made good what he then said, which wrought so upon the
distressed</i> Danes <i>at that time, that they have been Noted ever since
to be very great Cockers.</i></p>

<p><i>And Sir</i> William Corly, <i>who for some Years together was Resident in
the Danish Court, assures his Country-men that a right bred English
Cock, was at that Day accounted a Bird of Impreciable value in the
Court of</i> Denmark, <i>and that not only the young Princes, but the then
present King</i> Christian <i>himself was a great Admirer of the royal Sport
of Cocking, insomuch that they not only appoint set times (says he) but
do also hang out costly Ensigns, and Rich Flags, whereon is portrayed
both the place, and also the very Gesture of the Cocks, as they at</i>
Rome, <i>to which we find</i> Horace <i>alludeth;</i></p>

<p><i>Their Cockings also are attended with variety of Martial Aires, and
loud</i> Bellonian Notes, <i>with preparatory Sounds of War, which first
usher in the Cocks unarmed into the Pit, where both they and the
Weapons with which they are to fight, are exposed to the view of all
the Spectators that are present, after which they are taken up, and
immediately heeled, and then set down to Fight.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote_r">Vid. Virg Æn. 5.</div>

<p><i>For when a Cock of the Game is first brought into the Pit, to be
shown, he only makes a Flourish, and takes a lofty turn, or two.
But when he is heeled, and put in for the Battle, they then compose
their Bodies according to the rules of Art, for the better warding of
themselves, and the readier wounding of their Adversaries. And this
the late King</i> Christian <i>the First, of</i> Denmark, <i>was pleased to
take Notice of at public Cocking, where he professed that the Royal
Sport, so sweetly Sung by the</i> Mantuan <i>Swan, upon</i> Ascanius <i>Son to</i>
Æneas, <i>who first brought it out of</i> Troy, <i>was only an imitation of
Cock-Fighting.—Thus the Poet.</i></p>

<p>See here, <i>says the King</i>, how the Cocks Advance now one against
another, sometimes retiring, sometimes pursuing, sometimes in one Form,
and sometimes in another, what variety of Strokes, what Diversity of
Fight is here shown in this one Battle; were I to lead an Army against
the Grand Infidel of <i>Constantinople</i>, I would chuse none but Cockers
for my Commanders; nor should any common Soldiers be utterly Ignorant
of this useful Exercise of Cocking.</p>

<p><i>So great an Esteem had his Majesty the late King of</i> Denmark <i>for
Cocking. And that famed Hero, the young</i> Swedeland <i>King, at the
Head of a Handful of Men, cuts through the frozen</i> Muscovites, <i>and
makes the Haughty</i> Czar, <i>amidst his mighty Numbers tremble, and beg
for Peace, resolving never hereafter to draw his Cimiter against a
professed Cocker, as his</i> Swedeish <i>Majesty is notoriously known to be,
and has been from his very Cradle almost.</i></p>

<p><i>And the great Hector of</i> Europe, <i>the most Christian King</i>, Lewis <i>the
Fourteenth of</i> France, <i>is said to complain of nothing so much as the
want of Cocking in his Country, where the Climate is such, that a Cock
of the Game cannot bear the serenity, or rather the over Sharpness of
the Air, which penetrates the otherwise hardy Bodies of these Martial
Birds, to such a degree, that in a few days time they become so dull,
heavy, and heartless, that they have no mind to Fight, and quickly
after fall into some incurable Disease, such as the</i> Black-Sickness,
<i>the</i> Roop-evil, <i>and the like, of which they soon die.</i></p>

<p><i>Yet in the hottest Climates in the World, in the most Burning Regions,
such as</i> Frying-pan Bay, <i>and also in the Frigid Zone, where everlasting
Winter seems to dwell, are Cocks of the Game frequently known both to
Live, Breed, and Fight, and that as well as in any of the most Mild and
Temperate Climates of the World, where they are kept</i>, France <i>and one
part of</i> Spain <i>only excepted, which is a Wonder, and the natural cause
a Secret as yet undiscover’d.</i></p>

<p><i>In</i> Holland <i>they are common, and Cocking is there greatly practised,
and much encouraged by the States: And really it were to be wished
that our own Nation were but as much inclined to countenance and
encourage so innocent an Exercise as Cocking; and how great would the
benefit be, if in nothing else, the good effects of it would soon be
seen in this, that it would divert the English Gentry from effeminate
Dancing, Whoring, and Drinking, which are three Evils grown now almost Epidimical.</i></p>

<p><i>For want of Cudgel-playing, and Cocking, Men take to Drinking, and
Dancing, and now wear Swords more for shew than Service: a Basket-hilt,
with a Blade three Inches broad, such as our Valiant Ancestors had wont
to wear, is now derided by the effeminate Fops of our Days, who chuse
to hazzard their Lives and Fortunes in the fatal Arms of a diseased
Mistress, rather than venture a push at single Rapier, or take a turn
at Back-sword with a skilful Antagonist, where with their flaming
Blades they might hew bright Honour from the Errors of their Adversary,
and gild their memories with Applause in immortal Date.</i></p>

<p><i>And verily a better expedient to rouse the drowsy Courage, and thaw
the frozen Vallour of a People lull’d with soft Ease, and degenerated
into base and servile Effeminacy, there cannot be found out than Cocking.</i></p>

<p><i>Next to which Sword-play, and Wrestling are the most Laudable and
Masculine Recreations, and after these Hunting, provided it be a Chace
that has somewhat of Audacity in it, as the</i> Lion, Bear, Wolf, or Boar,
<i>all which are Bold and Noble Chases.</i></p>

<p><i>But to run Whooting after a poor timmérous</i> Hare, <i>or ride mading
over Hedge and Ditch in pursuit of a</i> Fox, <i>that perhaps has pinched
two or three</i> Geese, <i>or snap’d a</i> Lamb <i>from some unwary Shepherd,
and is therefore by</i> Diana <i>doomed to Die and briskly followed by her
rural Maids, dressed up each in her Cap and Feather, but for the
Sons of</i> Mars, <i>to be drawn forth after so feeble a Chase, is really
a very mean, and but little better than a base ignoble Divertisment,
that spends a Man’s Time, wasts his Treasure, and profits him nothing:
whereas Cocking fits a Man either for Peace, or War, and creates both
Courage, and Constancy, with Good-nature, and ingenuity all glued
together, according to the Poet, where he says thus;</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">————and some more Martial are,</span>
<span class="i0">But Cocking fits a Man for Peace, or War;</span>
<span class="i0">It makes Men bold and forward for the Field,</span>

<span class="i0">Heaven-born-boys that in Cocking delight,</span>
<span class="i0">Are ever true-hearted and constant in Fight.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>And verily in all my life, I never knew that Man yet that was a
Perfidious Man, or a real Coward, and yet loved Cocking intirely, so
dissonant is Cocking, and Cowardice, nay so inconsistent they are with
each other, that it is Morally impossible for a Coward unfeignedly to
love Cocking, and therefore some timerous Souls to avoid the odium of
Cowardice, have feigned a liking to Cocking.</i></p>

<p><i>And how any one can prove Cocking to be unlawful or wicked, I cannot
imagine, seeing God Almighty has no where declared against it, neither
has any Nation under Heaven ever made any Law against it, but divers
have been made for it.</i></p>

<p><i>If not for Combate, why was the Fighting-Cock created? why has he that
extraordinary hardness and vallour peculiar to him alone given him?
and for what other end was this Stout and Daring Champion made, if not
to Fight? the common Dunghill Cock eats as well, and breeds as well,
or better, and is as good about a house, and as useful in all other
respects (Fighting only excepted;) so that if they were not made for
that end, they had this excellency bestowed upon them in vain, and the
Royal Bird that in valour so far excells all other penigerous Creatures
must be but a useless thing at best.</i></p>

<p><i>But ’tis plain Nature intended the Fighting-Cock to be a Bird of great
use, and benefit to Mankind in several respects, as has already been
sufficiently noted: for this Bird by his Fighting teaches Man Skill,
and prompts him to be Stout and truely Valiant.</i></p>

<p><i>And though perhaps some few that understand not the right use of
Cocking, may follow it for ill ends.</i></p>

<p><i>But what’s all this to the purpose? I would fain know, shall an
innocent practice be forbidden to all, because some particular Persons
make ill use of it? what think you, did that sober King do well, when
he commanded all the Vines in his Dominions to be cut down, and by that
means starved all his Subjects, because some few of his Slaves were Drunk?</i></p>

<p><i>But must Cocking therefore be laid aside, because some do abuse the
greatest Blessings? no, by no means, but rather where we have one Pit
now, let us have two for the time to come; and as we ought, let us
improve this Exercise for the general good of Mankind, to which end it
was undoubtedly intended.</i></p>

<p><i>Thus I think I have fully proved this Sport to be very honourable, and
of ancient standing, and a thing in itself both Useful and Profitable.</i></p>

<p class="drop-letter_a drop-cap">Amongst all the Pleasures and
Delights this lower Sphere affords to Mortals here on Earth, there is
nothing more taking with the Heroic, and truely generous Soul, than the
Noble and most Princely Pastime of Cock-fighting, which really is in
itself a Recreation becoming the greatest Potentate, and surely most
suitable to all such whose natural Genius prompts them on to signalize
their Valour in the Field of Honour, where like the Cock fitted for
Battle, with their bright Arms they move their Fortune, and so raise
themselves to the highest pitch of Glory.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>So lively an Emblem of true Valour is the well bred-Cock, that he is
not to be parall’d amongst the many Creatures which the Wise Creator of
all things has been pleased to make Man the Lord and Master of.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Observable it is, that the best and bravest Men have ever had a high

Pleasure which he affords to Couragious Men, who joy in nothing more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
then to see him hew it out in Blood to the last drop: And though
reduced to the lowest Ebb of Fortune, yet even then to struggle with
Fate itself, upon the very brinks of Death, for Victory.</p>

<p>But having in the foregoing Preface fully treated of the great
Antiquity, Innocency, and Excellency of the Fighting Cock, I shall now
as briefly as I can, set down such necessary Rules, and Observations,
as are most requisite to be understood by all that practise the Royal
Sport of Cocking: and that I may prove the more successful in the
ensuing discourse, I shall endeavour to observe such a Method as may be
most agreeable to the end at which I aim.</p>

<p>Now my design herein, is not barely to illuminate the understanding
of such, whose want of Experience in the Art of Cocking has made
them mindless of the admirable Creature, and, possibly out of pure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
ignorance, to speak ill of they know not what, for <i>Nemo scientiæ
Inimicus nisi ignorans</i>. Nor do we find any more apt to inveigh against
Cocking, than those that least understand Cocks.</p>

<p>And therefore I have also here extracted such choice and rare Secrets
from the best and greatest Cock Masters, both Ancient and Modern, as
may serve to fortify, and improve the skill and knowledge of those
Gamesters which are already arrived at, and come up to a considerable
pitch of understanding in Cocking, insomuch that I am apt to think the
most skilful Master will not grudge at the Mony laid out upon this
Book, and if so? then surely the unexperienced will have no cause to
complain, who hitherto for want of good Instructions in this Art has
been deprived of the greatest delight, and the most solid Pleasure that
this lower Sphere affords to Men of Valour.

<h3><i>Of the Qualifications of a Game Cock.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_n.jpg" width="29" height="40" alt="N" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap">Now for the Election of these Royal
Warlike Birds, for that is the first step in Cocking, you must note
that there are four things chiefly to be observed in your choice of
Cocks, <i>viz. Courage, Close-heels, Shape, and Size</i>.</p>

<h4>1. <i>Of the Courage of a Game Cock.</i></h4>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_a.jpg" width="32" height="40" alt="A" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter_a drop-cap">And first I shall begin with Courage,
which is a thing so absolutely necessary in a Cock of the Game that
without it he can be nothing worth; and therefore be sure in your
Election of Cocks to secure to your self such as have good Blood in
their Veins, that is, such as are really and truly hard, Cocks that
will carry on a Battle to the very last, and utmost extremity, against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
all the disadvantages imaginable, and though cut down and choaked in
their own Blood, yet even then will rise and strike, or peck at least,
till they expire, and die: For truly I am of opinion that these Cocks
that happen to be worsted in their Fight so far as to be disabled, and
put past striking, and do then stand like stocks without pecking, or
making any resistance whilst their Antagonist hews them down (though
they die upon the spot) yet are they nothing worth, seeing they want
the true Valour, and innate Courage, which does indeed peculiarly
belong to the right bred Cock, who never fails to strike, or peck
whilst he has either Blood or breath left in him.</p>

<p>But here methinks I meet with some green Gamesters that will tell you
that they can with impunity pass by the Cowardice of a quick or close
stricken Cock, and that I am too curious in exacting so much Courage
from a Creature which is disabled, and put past the hopes of Victory in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
all probability; for their parts, all that they desire of a Cock is to
cut betime, and to convert his heels <i>Argent</i> into <i>Gules</i>, by which
they oft get the field <i>Or</i>, and that is as much as they desire; but as
for hewing it out to the last drop of Blood, and striking or pecking
when they are past standing, is a piece of such Gallantry (display’d by
a dying Animal) that they do not understand the bravery of, moreover
they will perhaps farther tell ye, that the Author of the Compleat
Gamester is altogether of another opinion.</p>

<p>But to silence such noises as these in a few Words, for no man that’s
veterane in Cocking will be of this Opinion, seeing experience daily
teaches us the contrary, and for that Gentleman that writ the Compleat
Gamester, speaking of Cocks, does indeed give the preheminence to close
heels, that is close striking, but when that’s done he requires true
Courage, and absolute hardness in a Cock, without which he tells ye
that he is not worth one Peny.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>But however, I must needs tell you, that Author is no great Conjurer in
the Art of Cocking, nor is he much to be regarded where he tells you
that a sharp heeler that is soft, is to be preferred before a Cock that
is hard but flat heeled, seeing both are to be rejected, in my Opinion
he might as well have said nothing: but he had been yet more shallow,
had he maintained or set forth, any thing that had but looked like the
want of Courage in a Cock of the Game, for how many Hundred Guinys has
there been won by Cocks cut and mangled Blind, Lame, and laid down for
dead, when from their dying sprunts they have borrowed an unexpected
blow, which has so far wrought upon their Adversary, as to give the
seemingly vanquished Cock the Victory, and on the other hand, who has
not seen divers deep heeling Cocks at a few blows cut thro’ more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
three parts of the Battle, and then meeting with some slight Wound
which has caused them basely to skut, and run away, loosing at once
their Master’s Coin, and Credit too, and all for want of being hard,
and true-bred at the bottom, wherefore I advise all such as are
desirous to be compleat Cock-masters, in the first place to have
respect unto the true Valour and hardness of a Cock.</p>

<h4>2. <i>Of a good Heeler.</i></h4>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_a.jpg" width="32" height="40" alt="A" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter_a drop-cap">And Secondly, Sharp Heels
claim your Care, and Regard, for should you have a Cock as hard as
Steel, and one that will strike as many blows as there are Stars, or
single Sands betwixt <i>Dover</i> and <i>Calis</i>, yet if he fall too short, or
strike too wide, and so fail to Point; what avails his vigorous Holds
and many Stroaks, when there no Execution follows? such a Cock at first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
indeed may make a fair Show, and Fight a while with as much Grace,
and seeming Gallantry, as if he Pointed true, and so fool the forward
Better out of his Mony, who sees him act at present as if he scorned to
be conquered by any thing but himself.</p>

<p class="center">————<i>Vt nemo Ajacem possit superare nisi Ajax.</i></p>

<p>But alass a little time will shew how vain such a Cock’s endeavours
are, and withall discover to the Judicious Eye, the mighty difference
betwixt a right Heeler and a Cock that cannot Point: And therefore I
say, that next unto Hardness, and Valour, you must have respect unto
Close-heeling, that is true Pointing, not but there are many ways to
help a Cock and make him Point well, that otherwise would do it but
indifferently (as I shall hereafter shew) yet if he be not naturally a
Sharpheeler, and Point tolerably true of himself, you can never confide
in him as otherwise you might, neither is he worth your keeping in my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
opinion, wherefore ’tis my advice, that in your Election of Cocks,
you be very curious in examining their Lineage; and if you find their
Progenitors were dull heel’d, wide, or short stricken, by no means be
prevailed upon to except of such a Breed, but on the other hand, if
you find they are descended from sure Heelers, such as have ever been
noted to Point true, and Point well in the Battles, then boldly venture
upon such a Bird, and doubtless you will find the good effects of his
generous nature, in the well discharging of his Battle, let him either
Winn, or lose: And as your Credit is hereby secured, so (if a right
Cock-master) you are content, and better pleased to see your Cock die
hard, and be handsomely beat, rather than basely, or by meer chance, or
the like to win his Battle.</p>

<p>For so sometimes I confess it falls out, and tho’ it be very rare, yet
I have seen a false-bred, foul foughten Cock matched against a true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Heeler, which has carried the Battle, broad Gold to grey Groats, till
on a sudden by a meer chance, or as the vulgar Cocker terms it, by an
unlucky Blow, the delicate Heeler has been Killed, and the worthless
Warriour has won the Day, tho’ little to his own, or his Master’s
Honour, for the Victory is wholly attributed to a meer Chance, and in
such a case nothing of Praise can redound to the conquering Cock. So
that you see if you have an ill-natur’d Bird that to a wonder winns
a Battle against a good Cock (which really is a thing that rarely
happens) yet you no Credit gain thereby, and therefore you had better
commit such a Cock to the Pot, than to the Pit, and more Profit you
will find in stewing him for the Table, than in stiving him for the
Battle, when once you discover him to be a Bird defective in his Heeling.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote_r">Vid. Bradbury <i>and</i> Willis.</div>

<p>But now notwithstanding this that I have said, yet is not every
Flat-Heeler always to be rejected, for the most Eminent Cock-masters
of our Days are of opinion that if a Cock come of a good Race, and
has true blood in him, and is not only fresh and full Feather’d, but
also Sound and well shaped, that such a Bird with a good Hen, will
breed as good Chickens as need to strike betwixt a pair of Wings,
notwithstanding that he himself hath not the knack of Pointing true
in his Fight: wherefore he ought (tho’ not for the Pit) yet for breed
sake to be preserved, and wholly set apart for Procreation; seeing his
Progeny ever proves good, and fit for the Field of War, if the Strain
be crossed in breeding.</p>

<div class="sidenote_r">Vid. Aristotle.</div>

<p>And who then (say they) would Pot so fine a Bird, whose Sire was a rare
Heeler, and perhaps a Brother or two of the same hatch, were as good as
ever struck, and for a need they’ll undertake to find you Forty Cockers
that shall swear it down upon any Pit in <i>Europe</i>, that what the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
<i>Stagerite</i> maintained concerning Men, holds good in Fighting-Cocks
also, for (say they) you shall seldom observe a Chicken take after his
Sire, when as nothing is more common than to see them in all respects
imitate an Uncle, a Grandsire or some such near Relation.</p>

<p>Now I confess this is a point of Philosophy which some of our greatest
Cock-masters maintain to that degree, that ’tis hard to argue them out
of it: And therefore that I may not appear absolutely repugnant to them
herein, I shall only say this (and leave them to enjoy their opinion)
that if a Flat Heeling Cock that is well descended, and come of a
good race (according to the Maxim they maintain) ought to be prised,
and set apart for breeding; I am sure it ought to pass currant and
unquestioned, as an Axiom in Cocking beyond dispute, that a Bird that
is right bred, and in himself a true Heeler also, is best and safest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
if not the only Bird to breed on; for I must allow room it seems for
the Flat Heeler (if he be well descended) but when that’s done, the
best Pointer is the best to breed of, in my opinion.</p>

<h4>3. <i>Of the Shape of a Game Cock.</i></h4>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_n.jpg" width="29" height="40" alt="N" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap">Now having furnished your
self with a breed that is stout and sure stricken; see then to the
Shape, and know that here you ought to be very nice and circumspect,
strictly examining every Part, and if by the severest scrutiny you
find your Cock to be foul Grown, or disproportioned, reject him as a
Bird unhandsome to look on, uneasy to Match, unwealdy in his Fight,
oft times unfortunate in his Battle, and for these reasons ever unfit
for breed, and consequently unworthy of your care, or least regard,
notwithstanding the Stock be never so good from whence he is derived.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>And therefore I shall here delineate and set forth to you the true
Shapes pertaining to a compleat Cock in all respects, whereby you may
be able with all the ease and facility imaginable, to discover the
defects and imperfections of these Birds, and give a right definition
of a Cock exactly Shaped, when need requires it.</p>

<p>And first I shall begin with the Head, which must be adorned with a
lofty tow’ring Frontlet, or Comb, smoothly cut into the exact Shape
of a Half Moon, so that rising in the Middle, it serves both for a
Guard, and an Ornament to the Royal Bird; his Beak, or Bill, ought
to be crooked, strong, and firm, of a middle size, and well jointed
in his Head, with large Nostrils therein: his Eyes should imitate
the Sparrow-Hawks, appearing quick, clear, and large; his Head ought
to be round, smooth and small; his Neck short, strong, and well
cemented, with a full set of Feathers for his Mane, that are strong and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
glittering Plumes, the better to set off his Crest, which ought to
rise a little in the middle: his Back strong, crook’d, and big at
the setting on: his Breast broad and large; his Body in all respects
strongly made, round, close and well built, penipotent, fresh, and
full Feather’d; his Legs strong, clear, and impennous, and if a little
crooked ’tis so much the better, for that always denotes a deadly
Heeler; his Feet with a Frog flat, and small therein; his Claws almost
straight, strong and sharp: and for his Spurs (so he have any) it
matters not what they be, seeing they are now of no use, save only to
set to the Weapons with which they Fight in pitched Battles. And as
for the Colour of your Cock, that is the best which you fancy most,
be it Black or White, Red or Dun, Grey or Piled, or any other Colour
whatever: For though Captain <i>Markham</i> makes a great difference in the
Colour of Cocks, preferring the Grey before the White or Dun, yet is
there nothing in it, for the World affords no better Birds for the Game
than many of your Duns, and Whites prove, both for Hardness and good
Heeling, as we daily see and experience.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The Scarlet colour’d Cock my Lord likes best,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And next to him, the Grey with Tresle-breast,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>This Knight is for the Pile, or else the Black:</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A third cries no Cock like Dun Yellow-back:</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The Milk-white Cock with Golden Legs and Bill,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Or else the Cuckoo, chuse you which you will:</i></span>
<span class="i0">Don Magnus <i>swears (of all) these are the best,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>They heel (says he) more sure than all the rest:</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But this is all meer fancy and no more,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The Colour’s nothing, as I said before.</i></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And therefore without taking any notice of the Colour, I shall only
hold you close, to the afore-mentioned shape as being the all, and only
parts necessary to make up a compleat Cock.</p>

<h4>4. <i>Of the right Size of a Game Cock.</i></h4>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_l.jpg" width="25" height="40" alt="L" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter_a drop-cap">Lastly, having obtained a Cock
that is hard, Sharp-Heel’d, and handsome shaped, it remains then that
you pitch upon a fit Size for your purpose, for otherwise you will
still be at a loss: Now tho’ there be almost as many different Sizes,
as there are several Cocks, yet are these Birds commonly reduced into
two sorts only, and distinguished by these two general terms, that is
to say, the great Game Cock, or Shake-bag, and the little Match, or
Battle-Cock.</p>

<p>First then of the Giant, or Herculean Cock called a Shake-bag by the
<i>English</i>, and <i>Dutch</i>, but by the <i>Indians</i> they are called <i>Mag
Chantille Champone</i>, and by the <i>Scotch</i>, who much esteem these gude
Birds, <i>Mag-Gal-And</i>, as <i>Baden</i> assures us; (says he) the word <i>Mag</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
signifies Great, or Mighty, both to the <i>Scotch</i>, and the <i>Indians</i>,
and is derived from the Latin Word <i>Magnus</i>, and by <i>Gal</i> may be
understood <i>Gallus</i> the Cock, and for the Word <i>And</i>, the Patron of
their Country St. <i>Andrew</i> is meant, who was (as he tells you) not only
a great and a gude Man, but also a mighty admirer of these Royal Birds,
wherefore they call them <i>Mag-Gal-And</i>, that is, Mighty Cocks of St.
<i>Andrew</i>, or, St. <i>Andrew’s</i> great Cocks: Birds Powerful in Battle,
<i>&amp;c.</i> And the <i>Indians</i> from <i>Chanticleer</i>, draw the Word <i>Chantile</i>,
and from <i>Champion</i> take the Word <i>Champone</i>, so that whereas they call
them <i>Mag-Cantille-Champone</i>, they might more properly and with more
Conciseness call them only great, or Champion Cocks, which is all that
is comprehended in their long jingle of Words.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">Why great Cocks are called <i>Shake-bags</i>.</div>

<p>And Dr. <i>Wilde</i> gives this Reason, why these sort of Cocks are called
<i>Shake-bags</i>; here in <i>England</i> (says he) they are so termed from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Scottish Custom that the Drunken <i>Dutchmen</i> have who are great admirers
of large Cocks, because they may be Fought at a venture, without the
trouble of Matching, and their way is (as he tells ye) to steep their
own Brains in Brandy, till they are not only past judging of a Cock’s
Size, but also past handling of him too, wherefore they neither see the
Cock they are to Fight with before hand, nor lay a hand upon their own,
after he is brought into the Pit, but take the Bag by the bottom, and
shake the Cock out at the Mouth upon the Pit, and so let him go against
his adversary, from which Custom they are called <i>Shake-bags</i> here in <i>England</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote_l">The Shake-bag Cock able to fight any thing.</div>

<p>But this Etimology perhaps may appear impertinent to some who have not
so great a regard to Cocks of the Game, as they deserve, but for the
more ingenious sort of Men, such I mean as are true lovers of Cocking,
I know will think nothing too much that tends to the promotion of these
Warlike Birds. And if so? seeing then the <i>Shake-bag</i> is a Cock judged
able to fight with any thing, and has this Excellency attending him
above the little Match-Cock, that you are never put to the trouble of
matching, which oft proves both difficult and dangerous too, unless
you are very skilful in handling: Also the great Game Cock is the more
profitable Bird in that he carries away the Prizes given by Public
Houses for their Custom, which serves not only to defray the Charge of
Dieting of them, but also pays for their Walk the Year following; And
therefore it is, that these <i>Shake-bags</i>, or great Game Cocks are by
some Men much preferred before the small battle Cock, or little match
Cock, call him which you will, and those think themselves the most
happy (for the most part) that can gain a Bird of the largest Size,
but in this they greatly err, who aim so much at Magnitude, for of
<i>Shake-bags</i> the largest rarely proves the best, and a wonderful great
Cock, seldom proves a Winning Cock; for they generally strike over, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
seldom, or never come to Point until they are so weakened with their
Wounds, that they can do no good, wherefore I advise them, who ever
they be, that delights in Shake-bags, to make choice of a cock that is
neither above Eight, nor yet under Six Pounds weight, when first he
is brought up from his Walk and put to Feed (for afterwards he will
weigh lighter if rightly managed) and with such a Bird, if right bred
and well Shaped, you may boldly venture to Fight the biggest Cock that
ever trod upon a Turf; for ’tis two to one upon the lesser Cock’s side,
because he not only lies under the great Cock, by which means he is
secured from almost all his blows, which for the most part are stricken
quite over, but he also has the advantage of under holds, and having
Strength withall to strike Home, and Close, he seldom fails to win, nor
is there any thing more common than to see the unwieldy Lubbers over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
wrestled, and by far less Cocks cut down and conquered, wherefore in my
opinion, the Cock that weighs nine or ten Pounds, or more, and measures
six or eight and Thirty, or perhaps nigh Forty Inches long, is by no
means a fit Bird to Fight, for a well turned Cock of six Pound weight,
shall with ease overcome such a useless Rumbo.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">Match not to be allowed in little Cocks.</div>

<p>But by the way, you must note, that this Rule in lesser Cocks is not
observeable, for altho’ a Cock of six or seven Pound weight, have
Strength and ability sufficient to conquer a Cock of nine or ten Pound,
yet it is almost impossible for a Cock that weighs but three Pound, to
beat a Bird that weighs five or more, for, observe it, and you will
find, that from a Cock of seven or eight Pound weight, down to the
smallest match, or battle Cock that you can meet with, and he will with
all the ease imaginable (when need requires it) bend himself in his
Fight, and proportion his blows suitable to the size of the Cock with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
whom he contends, so that in short he takes him in the rising, and
commonly Rucks him at the first coming in: And if meer chance prevent
it not, a hold or two, serves to lay the little Cock dead upon the spot.</p>

<p>But to speak no more of the Shake-bag, for truly notwithstanding all
that has been spoken in his commendation, yet is the little Battle Cock
much to be preferred before him, and that amongst others, for these Reasons.</p>

<div class="sidenote_r">Why little Cocks are better than great ones.</div>

<p>First he is easily reared, and far cheaper kept all along afterwards,
for the little Cock requires no more nor better maintainance than the
common Dunghill Cock, whereas the great Game Cock must be choicely
nursed and plentifully fed all his Life long, he knows not how to
Labour nor will he ever learn to get his living, your hand must still
sustain him or he comes to nothing, want quickly brings upon him the
<i>Black-Sickness</i>, and the lazy lubber dies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Secondly, the little Cock at a Year old becomes fit to Feed and Fight,
whereas the Shake-bag must be two Year old, or more, e’er he is brought into the Pit.</p>

<p>Thirdly, a Fortnights Diet serves the little Cock, whereas three Weeks
is not sufficient time to fit the great Cock for the Pit: and besides
all this, the little Cock not only requires less cost and care, but
also when he comes to Fight he affords you most Pleasure and Delight,
no sooner is he set down, but like Lightning he falls upon his Enemy,
Dances a Bloody round, and in his sparring Capers higher than your
Head, then links and never looses ’till his hold breaks, or his
Adversary dies. They rise and fall together, still striving to the last
which shall strike most, and hardest blows, Stabing each other without
intermission, till Death conclude the Combat.—O rare Birds! what
Pleasure upon Earth can equal this?</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">The way and manner of great Cocks Fighting.</div>

<p>But now the Shake-bag, or great Cock’s way of Fighting I confess is
very different from the little Battle-Cock, and in my opinion far less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
delightful: for first when you set the great Cock down, he slowly moves
towards the Warrior with whom he is to try his Fortune, and after
twenty turns and hovers, perhaps he strikes a blow, then stands again,
and either pecks, or may be scraps the Earth, as if he meant to Fight
no more, or else were willing to see the effects of his first blow,
e’er he a second struck; but first or last you shall have three or four
of these long flights, and that he thinks sufficient for sparring; for
after this, with <i>Spanish</i> Gravity he strides up to his Enimy’s Beard,
and takes a hold, and most irreverently there pulls and lugs him too
and fro, to try whether he may with safety rise and strike; for nothing
baulks a great Cock more than a Fall, because like Elephants, when
down, they find it difficult to rise; wherefore they seldom strike but
when their hold is strong, and then with their broad Lances they dig
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
such Orifices in each others bulky Sides, that like a Cane drawn, when
a Butt of Claret is set to Float, their stock of Blood flows forth,
boyling in bubbles as it rolls along the surface of the Earth, till
their Strength as well as Blood be so far exhausted, that they are
forced to strike their Beaks into the Earth, and makes their languid
Necks help to prop up their Sinking Bodies: so that set thus a little
to bleed their last, the Handler he steps in, and with a pinch behind,
hopes yet to make the dying Cock to rise and strike at all, though ten
to one he nothing hit: however, if he but peck, it serves to prolong
the time, and shews the hardness of the Creature, which indeed is all,
and in my opinion the only Excellency that pertains to Cocks of this
sort, and Magnitude.</p>

<p>But to leave every Man to his liberty, to make choice of which sort
of Birds best please him, I shall proceed in the next place to set
down such necessary Rules and Observations as shall be requisite to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
understood by all such as are desirous to be absolute Masters in
the true way of breeding these Royal Birds, both Match-Cocks, and Shake-bags.</p>

<h3><i>How to breed up Game-Cocks.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_s.jpg" width="26" height="40" alt="S" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap">SO then, if you are desirous to
breed a Cock of the Game, whose delicacy of Shape, and Excellency of
Heels, whose admirable hardness, and most exquisite deportment in all
respects, may not only prove pleasing, but also profitable to you:
Imprint these subsequent Lines in your Memory: so that when you come to
breed a Bird of this sort, you may not be wanting or unacquainted in
those Misteries practised by the ablest Masters, in the World at this
day, in the Noble Sport of Cocking.</p>

<h3><i>Of Cocks and Hens to Breed by.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_f.jpg" width="24" height="40" alt="F" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap">First then know that the Cock which you intend to breed
of, must be a Bird well descended, rightly Shaped, and sure Heel’d, he must also be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Healthful, Fresh, and full of Feathers, nor let so much as his Tail be
cut, for that greatly helps a Cock in his treading whereas the want of
it many times causes Eggs to be defective, and prove adle, and come to nothing.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">To Cross the Strain in breeding is best.</div>

<div class="sidenote_r">When to breed great Cocks, and at what Age to
Fight your Cocks.</div>

<p>And now in the next place we come to the Hen which you purpose to breed
of, for above all you must be exceeding careful herein, and therefore
she must either be the Mother, or Sister of some admirable Cocks, who
have been known to signalize their Valour in the Field of Honour,
and not only they, but also their Progenitors to have been Champions
renown’d for their Heroic deeds, your Hen also must be rightly Shaped,
Healthful, Fresh, and full of Feathers, and for her Age it ought to be
very different from that of the Cock, for if the Hen be old, then must
the Cock be young, but if the Cock be old, your Hen must be young; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
by no means let them be too near of Kin, for out of Brother and Sister,
or Father and Daughter seldom or never good Cocks are bred, for they
either prove thin, weak and ill Shaped, or else dull and false Heeled,
and for the most part prove soft, and are apt to skut, if ever they
come to be hewed, especially if they are great Cocks, for you must
be much more cautious in breeding of them than you need be about the
little match-Cock. And here note that <i>February</i>, <i>March</i>, and <i>April</i>,
are the only Months for breeding, if you are for great Cocks: but if
for small Cocks, <i>June</i>, <i>July</i>, <i>August</i>, or any time indeed serves
for them, provided you allow them to be full a Year old before they
Fight; but for the Shake-bag, he must be two Years old at least, before
he comes into the Pit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Of the Place proper to Feed at.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_b.jpg" width="26" height="40" alt="B" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap">But whether you breed big or little
Birds, when once you have pitched upon your Cock and Hen for that
purpose, see that you place them at a private Walk, where they go
undisturbed and free from the molestations of other Poultry: for if a
neighbouring Cock do but happen to come within the confines of your
Walk, he may do you a double diskindness; first by putting upon you a
spurious breed, a hatch of ill-natur’d Bastards of his own getting;
secondly, by Bathering of your Cock, so as to render him unfit for
breed, and make his Chickens nothing worth. For when once a Cock is
surfeited, he either fails to tread, or if he does tread, he is sure
to get distempered feeble Chickens; and a Cock is this way the most
apt of any to take a deadly surfeit, for being both foggy and full of
Feathers, he is soon heated and overstrained, and for want of Stiving,
his Blood grows stagnant, congeals, and becomes glutinous, not being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
able to circulate as Nature requires, for the carrying off of such
humours as are by this means raised to so contagious a degree, that
the whole Fabric of his Body becomes deeply infected with a Pluretic,
or some such like Malady, which seldom is discovered in time, and so
for the most part proves incurable: so that you may see by what has
been said, that another Cock is not to be endured within Crow of your
breeding Walk, nor indeed other Hens, though there be no Cock with
them, for they also in a great measure will be injurious to your Breed:
For a Cock is a most solacious Creature, naturally Hot, and extreamly
lustful, and when prompted thereto by variety of Mates, he is apt to
over-tread himself amongst his fresh Mistresses, whilst those you
intend him for, have least of his Strength bestowed upon them, and
assure your self this, that these Chickens which are thus got but in
part, will prove but to the halves; and therefore when you have a Cock,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
and Hens to your mind, see that your Walk be secure from all other
Poultry before you turn them down to breed, and in no case put above
two Hens to your Cock at a time, if you would have your Chickens lusty
and strong; your Walk also ought to be well watered and to yield a
competency of Meat, both for your Cock and Hens during the time of
treading, for as they should not be kept low and poor, so neither may
they be fed Fat, for that will render them unfit for Procreation,
making the Cock to tread seldom, and to yield but little Seed, and the
Hens no less guilty of false conceptions bringing forth abortive Eggs
without Shells, filled with nothing but Wind and slimy Matter, which
never comes to good, and therefore your Hand must here be gauged.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Of the Place proper for the Hens to lay in,<br />
and the manner of ordering the Eggs.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_n.jpg" width="29" height="40" alt="N" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap">Near unto the Roost, which ought
carefully to be secured from all sorts of Vermin, if you have the
conveniency of putting up a little Tablet, or Garret, where some
artificial Nests may be made to entice your Hens to lay there, I would
advise you to, for the better security of your Breed: And when your Hen
first begins to Lay, if you are desirous to have her sit quickly, let
all her Eggs remain together in the Nest, only do you carefully see to
the turning of them once a Day, until she sits, and afterwards also,
if the Hen do not save you that trouble, which you may know by marking
an Egg, if you do but take notice when she is off her Nest, but if you
would have good store of Eggs, and are in no hast of your Cock, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
only let the last Egg remain in the Nest, to entice her to come there
again to lay, and take the rest and put them carefully up into some
Wheat-barn, in a Baskit, Pan, or little Tub fit for the purpose, and
there keep them with turning, and that very gently too, until you find
your Hen inclineable to sit.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">The Hens that lay the Eggs best to sit them.</div>

<p>And let me here warn you never to set your Eggs (if you have any regard
for them) as some ignorant Persons do, under Crows, Turkeys, Ducks,
Dunghill Hens, or the like, for certainly, there is nothing that more
depraves a gallant parcel of Eggs, than putting them under such Hens
as those, who differ so much in nature from the Bird that layed them:
And this is seen by such as are Crow-hatched, for tho’ the Egg were got
and laid by the best Cock and Hen in the World, yet such a Bird when
he comes to Fight do nothing but lug, and pull, and hardly ever strike
as he ought to do; and if they are Duck-hatched, then they will strike
short, snutter, and be always upon their Noses: And as for those that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
are hatched under a Dunghill-Hen, if ever they are put to it, to Fight
in Blood for the Battle, ’tis ten to one that they skut, and run away,
being in Nature more hers that sat them than they are the Hen’s that
laid them, for we reckon the Egg after it receives the Tread, to be
Nourished but nine Days by the Hen before she lays it, whereas the Hen
that sits it, is twice as long before it be hatched, so that from hence
it may reasonably be inferred, that the Chicken is more the Hen’s that
sits, and Hatches it, than hers that laid the Egg, but sat it not; and
therefore, I chuse rather the Chickens that are Hatched by the same
Hen, that laid the Eggs.</p>

<div class="sidenote_r">Runners and Standers not good to breed together.</div>

<p>Know also, that if you take Eggs of a Hen that comes of a Strain
proceeding from a straining Fight, and put them under a Hen to Hatch
them that is by Nature a Runner, your Chickens will prove meer
Mongrils, and have a kind of nodling Fight with them, which is by no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
means commendable in a Cock of the Game, and for this Reason, never put
a Cock that has a standing Fight to a Hen that is of a shifting Breed,
for such Birds rarely prove well foughten when they come to be tried.</p>

<div class="sidenote_l">Broody Hens commonly hated by the Cock.</div>

<p>Now when your Hen is disposed to Sit if you can with conveniency remove
the Cock from that Walk, it will be a thing very grateful to your Hen,
who now no more delights in the Company of the Cock, nor the Cock in
hers, she slights his Court-ship, and by her froward carriage oft times
provokes him not only to dismantle, and strip her of her Plumes, but
also deprive her of her Life, unless she quit her self better in her
escape, for Broody Hens are ever hated by Cocks of the Game, especially
such Cocks as have in bloody Battles been engaged: but a Young
unfoughten Cock is not so dangerously cruel towards a Sitting Hen, and
therefore be farther trusted especially when the Walk cannot well be spared.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>How the Chickens are to be brought up.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote_r">Perfuming needless.</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_d.jpg" width="30" height="40" alt="D" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap">During the time that your Hen Sits you
must be careful in this, that when she comes off her Nest, she may
readily meet with her Craw full of good sweet Oats, and fresh Water,
but give her no Barly until she have hatched; and in her absence from
her Nest be you careful to turn her Eggs if need require it, and see
that no Hawk haunt the House whilst the Hen Sits: and when she is
hatching you must be very diligent in taking away her first Chickens
from her, least she quit her Nest too soon, and leave many of her Eggs
unhatched: give to each Chicken a little bit of White-bread, and dip
their Bills in new Milk, and then put them into a Basket of Sheeps Wool
close covered, and place it by the Fire until Night, at which time you
must also feed them again as before, and so put them under the Hen as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
she Sits upon her Nest, to hurk them all Night, and the next Day when
she comes off her Nest with her Flock, be they more or less, you must
be sure to put them into some dry warm place, where plenty of Groats,
Groundmalt, and such like Food may hourly be offered unto them, and a
shallow Sawcer of new Milk set for them to drink and bibble in, and
at the Fortnights end give them only Barly to eat, and fresh Water to
drink, and now (if it may be) let them have the benefit of the Sun, and
be admitted to walk in some Court, or Garden, where they may bather
and dust themselves in some Sun-shiny Bank, or Sandy Walk, which is a
thing that much delights and forwards Birds of this sort, and as their
Strength increases let their Walk be enlarged, but withall remember
that Weesles, Cats, and Kites are mortal Enemies to these young
Duellers, and that a nasty Sink, or Dunghill-hole is a most destructive
thing to Chickens, for they endanger, and breed ill humours in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Body, causing the Roop, Rot-gut and such like dangerous Diseases to
come upon them betime, which are Maladies seldom or never cured; and
therefore a walk that is clean, and dry, is ever to be best esteemed
for breeding Birds of this kind. But for Perfuming either the Chickens,
or the Room where they Roost, or by way of Antidote, to give them the
blades of choped Leeks, Skellians, or such like things, to prevent the
Roop, and other Diseases, proceeding either from foul feed, or ill
smells, are things in my opinion altogether needless, and may as well,
or better be let alone, than made use of; for certainly they avail
nothing towards the preservation of Health in Birds of this sort; for
when once they are able to eat it, give them but their fill of good
Barly, and fresh Water, with once in three Days a handful of Wheat, or
bread crums, and a clean Walk to range in, and you need do no more, for
thus managed you will see them thrive and come to your Hearts content.

<h3><i>When Cocks shou’d be Dub’d and Penn’d.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_l.jpg" width="25" height="40" alt="L" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter_a drop-cap">Let them Walk till the young
Cockerils begin to disagree, and when once you find they are
inclineable to quarrel, and raise up civil-Wars amongst themselves, you
must speedily take them up, and if they are strong enough, cut their
Combs and Wattles, and not before; for if you cut them too early, there
will be no Comb remaining either to grace or guard the Head, and he’ll
look so Capon like, that you will hate to see him when turned into
the Pit. But on the other hand, if you let them wear their Wattles a
Year, or may be five Quarters, as some unwisely do, they will then be
heavy headed, and in spight of Fate must needs loose a World of Blood,
which of all things is the most hurtful to a Cock of the Game; and,
therefore, as you may not before a Quarter old at soonest, so you may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
not exceed three Quarters at the farthest, before you dub your young
Cocks, for the Reasons aforesaid: And in cutting, if you observe this
for a Rule, to leave the Comb round like a Half-moon, it will make the
Cock appear as it were Roman-nos’d, or Hawk-bill’d, and will not only
be a good guard to his Head, but will render him much handsomer to
look upon: Whereas close cutting makes them appear sneaking, and also
much weakens the Beak of a Cock, and by that means many times looses
the Battle. But when you Cut, or Dub your Cocks, be sure to put them
up into the Pens for a Week, or more, until you find their Wounded
Heads begin to shell and heal; and this imprisonment will be of double
advantage to the young Cocks, for it will both acquaint them with the
Pens, and give you the advantage of often handling of them, which is
the most compendious way to make them become tame and gentle, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
which qualification, or good property, a Cock (tho’ never so well bred)
is not to be trusted to Fight for any considerable Wager: for should he
come to be sett, it is ten to one he skuts, and basely quits the Pit,
and that more for fear of being handled by the feeder, than hurt by the
other Cock, and so looses the Battle for want of prehandling, and being
made tame, and gentle before he comes to Fight: And therefore, as ’tis
a most notorious Crime in a Cock of the Game to be wild or shie, so it
is as weak and silly in a Master, to Fight such a Bird, before he be
familiaris’d, and made bold and gentle.</p>
<h3><i>When Cocks should be set out to Walk, and where.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_a.jpg" width="32" height="40" alt="A" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter_a drop-cap">And now in the next place, after this
Penning, and his Wounded Head is got well, you must send him to a Walk,
where (like an absolute Monarch) he may Reign without controul, and be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
beyond the hearing of the hourly challenges of neighbouring Cocks,
which is a thing apt to stir their Choller, and therefore it is that
Captain <i>Markham</i> so much commends a Lodge, a Grange-house, or Mill,
because that, for the most part, they are places remote, and far from
Neighbours. And as you are always to chuse a Walk that is grac’d with
Solitude, having green Fields, or pleasant Meadows on one hand, with
Mountainous, Hilly, dry Ground on the other, and a murmuring Brook, or
twatling Rivelet, or in their stead some pleasant Pools, or Ponds of
clear sweet Water, with a good Barndoor, or else some loving Hand from
the House that may daily afford plenty of Corn, especially if the Cock
be large; So should you, if possibly you can, avoid the having of too
many Hens in your Walk, for look how many above six your Cock walks
with, so many Mates has he too many; and, indeed, had he but two or
three it’s enough, and the Walk would be the better: for many Hens make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
a Cock to tread often, and much treading greatly debilitates a Bird of
the Game, and makes him feeble when he comes to Fight; tho’ length of
time and good Feeding will much restore a Cock that is decayed by hard
Treading.</p>

<h3><i>Of a proper Roost for Cocks.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_a.jpg" width="32" height="40" alt="A" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter_a drop-cap">And now for the Roost of your Cock,
which is one of the choicest things you are to look after in his Walk,
for it makes or marrs a Cock I assure you; and therefore know, that
there is nothing better than a Beam, or broad Struncheon, wraped round,
and close with well twisted Thum-ropes of Hay, into which he may set
his Claws, and by that means hold himself fast without stradling, or
lying wide with his Legs: Whereas if his Roost be either small or
narrow, he is forced to sit wide, and gripe hard, to hold himself on;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and this many times spoils a good Cock, and makes him not worth a
Groat, that might otherwise have been a Jewel of impreciable Value;
and therefore be sure to be very careful and curious in the Roost:
and see that the Floor be not too hard on which he is to light when
he is to descend from his Roost, for that will be apt to break his
Claws, and bruise his Feet, and make him Club-footed, and Gouty;
neither is it good to give a Cock Meat either upon a Brick, Plaister,
or Boarded-floor, for that will much harm the Bill, or Beak of a Cock,
making it blunt, and dull, and many times breaks it quite off, to the
spoyling of the Bird at present.</p>

<h3><i>Of Sparring young Cocks and its use.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_a.jpg" width="32" height="40" alt="A" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter_a drop-cap">And here by the way give me leave
to recommend to you the frequent sparring of your young Cocks: I
confess ’tis a thing practised by few or none, and by the generality of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Cock-masters judged injurious and hurtful, and therefore much declaimed
against; yet notwithstanding all this, I have practiced it for many
Years, with good success and advantage; And do constantly affirm it to
be one of the greatest helps that can be conferred upon a young Cock,
provided it be performed by a Skilful Master, whose care and diligence
may be manifested in the well ordering of the Cocks in these their
early heats: And a better way I know not than this, which I have ever
observed, and been very successful in.</p>

<p>First then, after you have placed a young Cock some little time at his
Walk, where he Reigns like a supream Lord and Master over all, without
the least controul, or molestation from any Antagonist, then take a
Brother, or some other young Cock, as near to his Age and Size as may
be, and go to this his Walk, and there, after having secured their
budding Spurs, by putting them on little Hutts made for that purpose;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
<i>Take</i> Ive-berry-leaves, Ground-Ive-leaves, <i>bruised with</i> Herb of
Grace, Sweet Butter, <i>and the fine Powder of brown</i> Sugar-Candy, <i>mix
these well, and make them into Pills as big as a large Bean</i>, give to
each Cock a Pill, or two, and then turn them down in some green Field
or Pasture, where they may run if they please, and by hard Wrestling
and Sparring, heat themselves until they begin to close, and come
to mouth it; then take them up and loose their Hutts, and bag them
close, for should you permit them longer to Combat, they will by heavy
strokes bruise and bather each other, and with deep mouthing displume
themselves, and thereby make the damage far greater than the advantage
would have been, had they been rightly managed.</p>

<p>Now the Bags wherein you put your heated Cocks, must be well lined
with Rie Straw, and set in some warm place, for three or four Hours at
least, and supposing it then near Roosting time, take the Cocks out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the Bags, and give to each a White-bread Toast, soaked in warm Urine,
for there is nothing that tempers and cleanses a Cock after Sparring
better than such a Toast. Also let the Head and Feet of the Cocks be
well suppled, and bathed in warm Urine, and then put them up to Roost to
the Hens, and so leave them to their Walks.</p>

<p>And thus if you serve your young Cocks once, or twice a Quarter, until
they come to be of Age, fit to put up to Feed, you will find the good
of it, in that they will grow both skilful and cunning in Fight; their
Wind will be lengthened, their Sinews grow stronger, and their Joints
more plyant, and flexible, and they in all respects more able, and
powerful in Fight by much, than such as perhaps have hardly seen a
Cock, or at least seldom or never been Sparred until they come to be
put up and Dieted for Battle: And truly hence it is that we often see
Cocks that have been well bred, Fight but very indifferently the first
Battle, and come off but poorly, and all for want of early and often
Sparring before they come to Fight.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>The method of Dieting, &amp; feeding Game-Cocks.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_b.jpg" width="26" height="40" alt="B" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap">But having gone thus far in Cocking,
I shall in the next place, proceed to give some directions to know
and understand the best way and means made use of by the ablest
Cock-Masters of these times, in the way of ordering of Cocks, when put
up to be Fed, or Dieted for to Fight: For I have often grieved to see
a gallant Cock meerly lost and cast away for want of good feeding, and
at the same time been no less sorry for the Owners of such Cocks, who
perhaps were Gentlemen of Worth, and Quality, that delighted in the
Royal Sport of Cocking, and with a World of Care and Cost, have brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
up, and reared Cocks to be fit for feeding, and then unfortunately have
put them into the hands of some unskilful Rascal that shall pretend to
be a Feeder, tho’ he know no more than a Horse, how to Diet, or Order a
Cock he should be Ordered to Fight. And hence it is that many an honest
Gentleman looses his Mony, many a good Cock his Life, and both of them
their Credit, and all for want of a good Feeder.</p>

<p>Now that no Gentleman Cocker may ever hereafter dash upon this common
Rock, on which so many have been split, provided they keep to the
Directions given in the following Pages, wherein they shall find all
the Secrets and most hidden Misteries in Cock-feeding, laid open to
them in terms so plain and easie, that they shall be able both to
correct and instruct the mercenary Feeder, who Diets Cocks for Hire,
and heeds not how they speed, when once they are out of his hands, and
perhaps knows as little how to manage them as they should be whilst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
they are in his Custody, and therefore to prevent your giving of Mony
to have your Cock marred, or that you may not pay for his being Pined
instead of being Fed (as divers have done) or if not so, perhaps
suffocated thro’ too hot or too high feed, and want of due Sparring
with other such like injuries, too often put upon poor Cocks, by
ignorant unskilful Feeders, I shall here make known to the great greif
and sorrow of all such selfish narrow Soul’d Cock-Masters, who have
made it their business rather to conceal, and lock up, than to divulge
and make known the rare Art of Feeding.</p>

<p>And take it thus: First when your Cocks are brought up to feed, see
that they are fresh, full, and fine in their Feathers, and that
their Wings are strong and good; Examine also their Legs, and Feet,
whether they be clean, unclubed, and free from the Gout, and such like
swellings, and have all their Claws, and whether their Bill, or Beak be
firm, sharp and strong; what plight of Body they are in, whether they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
look ruddy about the Head; and if so (provided they are of Age) you
may then cut their Tails, and put them into the Pens to Feed: And let
the first Meat that you give them be of a cleansing, drying quality;
and therefore good clean, dry Barly that is sweet and free from Seeds,
Spirt, or Mouldings, is a proper Food enough for the three first Days,
with fresh Water to drink along with it.</p>

<h3><i>When and how to Sparr your Game-Cock.</i></h3>

<p>And now let them be lustily Sparred, and long Stived, especially if
they are Fat, and full of Flesh. But if a Cock be poor and low in
case, you must then be more moderate, and not Stive, and Sparr so
hard, least you over do him, and perhaps quite Kill him, or at least
worst him so far, that he may not recover it again of many Days, and
therefore besure strictly to examine what plight your Cock is in before
you either Sparr or Stive him, and see that after you have hutted your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Cocks, and by that means secured their Heels, forthwith then give to
each Cock a Pill, or Roll as big as a Walnut made up in two or three
Parts, and prepared in the following manner.</p>

<h3><i>To make the Scowering Pill.</i></h3>

<p>Take of white <i>Sugar-candy</i>, <i>Rosemary</i>, <i>Fetherfew</i>, <i>Ground-Ivy</i>
bruised, mingle these with Sweet Butter, let the <i>Sugar-candy</i> be
finely Powdered, and let these be well incorporated together, and just
before you give the Cocks these Pills, put them into warm Urine; and
these will cleanse a Cock of Grease, add to his Strength, and lengthen his Wind.</p>

<h3><i>When and how to Stive your Game-Cocks.</i></h3>

<p>And after the Cocks have been Sparred (as aforesaid) let them take a
Diaphoretic, or Sweating after this manner: First take off their Hutts,
and then immediately Stive them very close in some warm Room, where no
penetrating Air can come to annoy the heated Cocks; for otherwise they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
will loose the benefit of their Sparring, and in these Stoves you must
leave the Cocks for three or four, six, eight or ten hours together,
according as the Cocks are in Strength and Flesh; for a poor weak Cock
will not bear long Stiving: And now in the Cock’s absence let their
Pens be cleaned, and fresh Straw be put into them, and if need be,
you may then alter their Perches higher, or lower, or remove them to
another side of the Pen, as you see cause for it.</p>

<p>And when you take the Cocks out of the Bags or Stives, lick with your
Tongue the Eyes and Heads of them, and so put them into their Pens,
and so fill their Troughs with Cock-bread cut into small square bits,
and steept in Urine, that so the Cocks may feed whilst ’tis warm; for
this will cause their Scowering Pills to work and greatly cleanse, and
purify both the Head and Body of your Cock.

<h3><i>Of the several Ways of making Cock-bread.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_n.jpg" width="29" height="40" alt="N" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap">Now to make Cock-bread aright, and at
the same time, to have it suit with every Feeder’s humour, is a thing
altogether impossible; seeing we are <i>quot Homines tot Sententiæ</i>.</p>

<h4><i>How to make the ordinary Cock-bread.</i></h4>

<p>Some fancy that the common Bakers Bread is as good as any: Others will
tell you that there must be some <i>Bean</i>, or <i>Pease</i> Meal put amongst
it, and a few <i>Anniseeds</i>, with the Whites of Eggs; and this is the
best Cock-bread say they.</p>

<h4><i>Another Receipt for to make Cock-bread.</i></h4>

<p>But there are others will tell you, that you must take of <i>Wheat</i>,
<i>Pease</i>, <i>Beans</i>, and <i>Oates</i>, of each a like quantity in <i>Meal</i>, or
<i>Flower</i> finely dressed, with the Juice of <i>Liquorish</i>, and a little
<i>Sack</i>, or strong <i>Stale-Beer</i>, with Brown <i>Sugar-candy</i>, <i>Anniseeds</i>,
<i>Carroway-seeds</i>, mixed together: But if the Season be very hot, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
must put <i>White-Wine</i> instead of <i>Sack</i>, and as much common Ale as will
make the Flower up into Dough, with the Whites of ten or twenty Eggs,
and a Yolk or two amongst them; and this they take to be the best sort
of Bread for to Feed Cocks withall.</p>

<h4><i>How to make the best sort of Cock-bread.</i></h4>

<p>But in my opinion there is yet a better sort than any of these, and
I make it thus, <i>viz.</i> of the best and finest Wheat-meal, I take
three-quarters of a Peck, and one quarter of Oat-meal of the purest
sort, and first of all mix these well together; then add the Whites
of twenty new laid Eggs, four Yolks, an Ounce of the best extract of
<i>Liquorish</i>, and as much of the fine Powder of brown <i>Sugar-candy</i>,
a quarter of an Ounce of <i>Anniseeds</i>, and <i>Carroway-seeds</i> grossly
bruised, with a Lump of good sweet <i>Butter</i> as big as your fist at
least, and a quarter of a Pint or more of the best <i>White-Wine</i> that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
can be bought for Mony, with three or four spoonfulls of Syrup of
<i>Clove-gilliflowers</i> put into it, and a Date or two, with some Candyed
<i>Eringo Roots</i> cut very small so that it may be scattered into every
part, and let these Ingredients be all well worked together, in some
Tub, or Pan fit for that purpose, with your hands, until you are
Satisfied that they are thoroughly incorporated.</p>

<p>Then take <i>Wood-sorrel</i>, <i>Ground-Ivy</i>, <i>Featherfew</i>, <i>Dandelion</i>,
and <i>Burrage</i>, of each a like quantity, and distill them in a cold Still,
and add three or four Spoonfuls of the pure Juice of <i>Lemmons</i> to every
Pint of distilled Water; And add as much of this Julip as will serve to
make all into a good stiff Past; let this be wrought quick, and made
into little flat Loaves, which ought to be a day or two old before you
spend them, and then being well rasped, or pared, so that none of the burned
or brown outside remain, they may then be cut and given to the Cocks, as aforesaid.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>And this I take to be the best and fittest sort of Bread for English
Cocks, it being a Food that does greatly strengthen and exhillate
them, and at the same time cools, and keeps them Temperate in their
Bodies, provided you have regard to the Season; for in Hot Weather, or
where the Climate is more than ordinary hot, there must be more of the
cooling Ingredients added; and fewer, or a less quantity of those that
are hot in Nature.</p>

<h3><i>Of other Food used by some for Game-Cocks.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_t.jpg" width="31" height="40" alt="T" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap">There are those that think the finest
Wheat-bread, with good store of hot Spices in it, and soaked or
sprinkled only with the simple Water or Juice of <i>Wood-sorrel</i> to be
the best of Food for a Cock.</p>

<p>And some again heed not what Bread they have, so that they have but good
store of Flesh to give their Cocks, crying that up for the best and strongest Food.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>But in my opinion these extreamly err in fancying Flesh to be Food fit
for a Cock, these carniverous Sots understand not the nature of these
valiant sort of Birds, who force such unnatural food upon them, nor is
it possible for a Feeder to make a Cock strong, and at the same time
Fight cool, and be long winded with such sort of Diet.</p>

<h3><i>How a Game-Cock should be Fed before he Fights.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_b.jpg" width="26" height="40" alt="B" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap">But suppose your Food to be either
this, or that, or what you like best, be it what it will, yet is this
on all hands agreed on by every one that pretends to Feeding, that
the last Meal you give your Cock before he Fights must be common
Manchet-bread, such as the Bakers usually make, with good store of Barm
therein, and what they sell at every Market; for this sort of Bread is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
ever very light and goes off quick, it being soon digested, leaves
the Craw or Crop of a Cock fine and clean, and so it ought to be when
your Cock Fights, for otherwise you do in effect but throw your Cock away.</p>

<p>And tho’ ’tis highly necessary to bring a Cock into the Pit clean and
empty, yet you may, and ought to give him five or six little bits of
par’d <i>Pippin</i> put into a Cup, or Dish of Spring Water, out of which
let him pick the Apple, and drink a little if he pleases, of the Water:
Or, for want of Apple, you may (as I said before) give your Cock a bit of
White-bread, and drink after it, and so turn him into the Pit to try his Fortune.</p>

<h3><i>What Water is best for Cocks.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_s.jpg" width="26" height="40" alt="S" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap">Some Feed their Cocks twice a Day, and
others three times, and Water them after each Feeding, and that for the
most part with common Fountain Water; but the following <i>Barly Water</i>
is the best, especially in the Summer, and indeed all the Year long,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
where the Climate is any thing hot and Sultery: As in <i>Jamaica</i>,
<i>Madera</i>, <i>Bermudas</i>, <i>Guardeloope</i>, and <i>Pettiguavers</i>.</p>

<p>For this Water excellently cools, and wonderfully refreshes the Vital
Spirits that labour under Heat; it has also a cleansing quality, and
is highly restorative where Feaverish Distempers afflict the Body; and
therefore to be preferred before simple, or Common Fountain Water.</p>

<h4><i>To make Barly Water.</i></h4>

<p>Take <i>Barly</i> and boil it in Spring Water, and let it stand to cool
and settle; then pour off the Settlings, and give this to your Feeding-Cocks.</p>

<h3><i>Concerning the Method of Trimming Game-Cocks.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_a.jpg" width="32" height="40" alt="A" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter_a drop-cap">And for the Trimming of a Cock it is
a thing so well known to almost all that ever saw a Cock of the Game,
that I need not say any thing of it, but leave every Country to follow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
their own Fashion; for I must tell you that I have known some Feeders
more angry when they have been told this, or that way is best, or looks
most genteel, than a <i>Spaniard</i> when he is told of his Trunk Breeches,
who strait claps his hand upon his Sword cries, <i>Sacrament, me breech
te boon breech by Gar, dam your French Fashions</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Heeling of Game-Cocks.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_a.jpg" width="32" height="40" alt="A" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter_a drop-cap">And for the Heeling of a Cock there
can no certain Rule be given for that, because the way, and manner of
some Cocks Fighting requires their Heels to be set extreamly high;
others exceeding low: This Cock must have his Heels fixed narrow, and
that Cock as wide as they can be set.</p>

<p>And therefore I would let no man Heel a Cock, unless he has first seen
him Sparr, and know his way of Striking, let him be never so great an
Artist at Heeling, I heed not that; but think him fittest to Heel the

<h3><i>The Methods of Matching Cocks.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_t.jpg" width="31" height="40" alt="T" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap">Then as for Matching of Cocks, ’tis now
all the Mode of late to Weigh them, so that be they thick or thin, long
or short, they take their chance, falling in according to Weight, let
their Shape be never so different.</p>

<p>But in my opinion, the good old way of Matching small Cocks is still
the best way, and most exact; to Measure them by Hand, and Match by
the Eye (if the Handler have any Skill) will make them fall in tite:
Besides, a Cock that is well fed shall Weigh far lighter than one that
is ill Fed, or not Fed at all.</p>

<h3><i>Concerning the right Handling of a Cock.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_i.jpg" width="29" height="40" alt="I" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap">I Come now to the Handling of a Cock,
wherein a great deal of Art is required; and divers niceties, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
ought very curiously and strictly to be observed, and carefully
performed also: For there is both a Lady’s Hand, and a Hawk’s Eye, a
Fox’s Head, and a Lion’s Heart, to be found in every skilful Handler;
and he that is wanting in any one of these, is a Person very unfit to
have the management of a Cock, when turned into the Pit to Fight.</p>

<p>For a rough Handler will make his Cock affraid of him, and perhaps make
him run away when he is sorely wounded, rather than stay to be griped
by so heavy a Hand as his Master carries.</p>

<p>And if he be a Man that is not quick in discovering of Wounds, be they
either given or received by his Cock, he can never play his Bird of War
to the best advantage.</p>

<p>And farther, if he be not cunning in his Handling, either to get, or
sometimes to avoid a Blow, and that without being discovered by the
adverse party, he is unfit for the Office.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>And lastly, he must be bold, and fearless, and as well Patient as
Painful and Laborious in handling his Cock to the last, for whilst
there is Life, there is Hope, if your Cock be true bred, and Fortune
has more than once turn’d the Scale, and given the Victory to the dying
Cock even at the last minute of the Battle.</p>

<h3><i>How the Wounded Cocks, after Battle, should be ordered.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_a.jpg" width="32" height="40" alt="A" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter_a drop-cap">And now in the next place we come to
direct you how to order your Cocks after they have fought.</p>

<p>First then, as soon as the Battle is over, and you have taken up your
Cock, whether he has won or lost, (if you deem him worth the saving)
forthwith search him all over, and as many of his Wounds as you can
find, you must speedily suck very clean, and by that means draw all
the Blood and clutters out of them, then wash him with warm Urine, and
give him a Roll or two of your best Scowering, and so stove him up very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
soft, and warm for two or three Hours or more, and then drawing him out
of the Bag by the Fire side, or some other warm place, where no Air can
come to harm him, gently open his Wounds, and pour into them the Oyl of
Turpentine, and let it be somewhat more than just warm, yet let it not
be scalding hot neither; and be sure to see that it be the best of the
sort: Then give him five or six bits of soft White-bread diped in warm Urine.</p>

<p>And then gently take your Wounded Cock and put him into the Bag again,
and let him not feel the Air till his swelling be abated, and his
Wounds well nigh Healed up, which will be in a day or two’s time,
provided his Wounds are not too deep, and numerous: And then you must
put him into the Pens, where you may feed him twice a Day with Bread or
Barly, and once a Day dress his wounds, as aforesaid, until he is fully
cured; and then turn him out to his Walk to Grass, and pick Gravel till
you find him fit to send to Feed again for another Battle.

</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap"><i>Sorrel</i> is moderately cold, and dry,
somewhat binding, and cutteth tough humours, it cools the Blood and
greatly provokes Appetite, and therefore is a rare thing for a Cock in
his Food when the Season is hot, it being one of the best Coolers that
I know.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap">The Leaves of <i>Box</i> are very binding,
and of Singular use for Cocks of the Game that are troubled with a
loosness, and too much Scowring, provided you powder the Leaves, and
mix therewith a tenth part of the inner Bark of <i>Elm-tree</i>: Sift this
Powder thro’ a fine Searce, and make it up into Pills with Sweet
Butter, and give it the Cocks in two or three Pills as big as large
Filberts, and let them Fast an Hour or more after them before they Eat or Drink.

<h3><i>How to Cure the Roup.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_a.jpg" width="32" height="40" alt="A" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter_a drop-cap">Another Malady there is that these
Birds of Game are incident to, which is commonly called the Roup,
which like to a filthy Boyl, or swelling you may discover upon the
Rump of your Cock, or Hen Chicken; and it will in a short time (if not
prevented) corrupt the whole Body.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>You may first perceive it by the staring, and turning back of the
Feathers that are about it; and if you purpose to cure it, you must
speedily pull away those Feathers, and lay the Place open so as to
thrust out the Core; and then Syringe the place well with Salt and
Urine, after which lay some Tarr thereon, and the Cure will be effected.</p>

<h3><i>How to cure the Pipp.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_t.jpg" width="31" height="40" alt="T" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap">The Mallady called the Pipp, proves
of dangerous consequence if not soon lookt after, for they are hereby
rendred unable to Feed; and unless speedily prevented by uncaping the
Tongue, they pine away, and die for want of Food, tho’ set in the midst
of a Grainery.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>And therefore when you see a White Scale upon the tip of your Cock or
Hen’s Tongue, you must with a Needle, or your Thumb-nail get it clean
off, and rub the end of the Tongue well with Salt.</p>

<h3><i>To Kill Lice in Cocks or Hens.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_l.jpg" width="25" height="40" alt="L" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter_a drop-cap">Lice also are an infirmity common to Cocks and Hens, and usually
proceeds from some one of these three things, either thro’ Poverty,
and want of Food, or else from foul corrupt Food, or for want of Sand,
Ashes, or the like, to bath, and cleanse themselves in.</p>

<p>Now they are cured by taking Pepper pounded small, and put into warm
Water with which let them be well washed.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Gout and its Cure.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_t.jpg" width="31" height="40" alt="T" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap">The Gout is a certain swelling either
in the Claws, or Ball of a Cock’s Foot; it is sometimes hard, and
sometimes soft and poosy, but ever hot and burning, and is a very
troublesome Malady, and seldom so thoroughly cured as to render the
Cock fit either to Fight or Breed after.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>’Tis a hereditary distemper in some Cocks; but in others it proceeds
from Wounds and loss of Blood, especially when once they begin to grow
old, and Humours to grow predominant in them.</p>

<p>I shall here for the Readers benefit mention a trial of Skill which I
made upon a very choice Cock of my own, thro’ the help and assistance
of a Gentlewoman whose extraordinary Skill both in Physic and Surgery
was well known and greatly Celebrated by all that were acquainted with her.</p>

<p>Now the Cock was about two Years old, fresh, fine, and in good tune
when I sought him, and he came of a rare Breed, and was delicately
Shaped, and sparr’d as fine as most Cocks that ever I saw in all my
Life; but for all this meeting with a blow in the Throat at his first
coming into the Pit which choaked him up, and being also veined in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Foot at the same time, from which wound he lost a World of Blood, he
was at last very hardly, and with much difficulty beaten.</p>

<p>However I was offered half a Peice for him as he lay in my Hands
seemingly Dying, but I refus’d it: And taking him Home observed the
afore-mentioned method, ordering him as is directed for Cocks after
Battle, (<a href="#Page_67"><i>Page</i> 67</a>) by which means I soon recovered him and (as I
thought) had him perfectly well.</p>

<p>But truly it was not long before I found I was under a mistake, for my
Cock began to Limp, and grow Gouty, by reason of a Humour which fell
down into that Foot in the which he was veined, and had lost such a
great quantity of Blood when he fought last, so that in short it began
to heat and swell betwixt the Claws, yet was it not very dicernable.</p>

<p>However I took him up, and having carefully searched his Foot, and for
some Days applied Shoe-makers-Wax to it, but finding it not to do, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the Gout growing worse, I took him to the ingenious, and most Skilful
Gentlewoman aforesaid, who promised me to do her best for the recovery
of my valiant Cripple.</p>

<p>At first she Poultised his Foot, and after that applied the most
violent drawing Salves, but to no purpose; for neither <i>Venice
Turpentine</i>, nor all the Vehement things that she could think on would
do any thing; until she applied <i>Burdock</i> Leaves to it, in the nature
of a Poultise, and that, after some time did draw it, and brought away
abundance of viscous, putrified Matter.</p>

<p>After which she tried to heal the Wound, but to no purpose, for it
broke out again, whereupon I took out the Ball or Frog of the Cock’s
Foot, and the Gentlewoman healed it again, but it swell’d after this
and broke of itself, and run at several Places, so that I was forced a
second time to cut out the Ball of my Cock’s Foot, and then after long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Salving, with the Application of some drying Powders it was healed up
firm and well, and his Foot proved sound and good to his dying Day,
but was greatly Clubbed and ugly to look upon, yet did he breed good
Chickens and fought divers admirable Battles after this, to my great
delight and satisfaction.</p>

<p>And this I only mention by the way, to shew that if you will but use
care with some little cost, and add thereto Pains and Patience, most
Distempers will be found curable.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Black Sickness.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_t.jpg" width="31" height="40" alt="T" />
</div>
<p class="drop-letter drop-cap">The <i>Black Sickness</i> is a Disease so
highly destructive to Cocks of the Game, that Men try in vain to cure
that incurable Distemper, when once it is got into the Blood, and the
Cock or Hen begins to blacken about the Head, and grow Sick withal, no Medicine
as yet was ever found that could retrieve a Cock from Death in such a condition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>And therefore to free the Royal Warrior from a Languishing Death, when
once he appear to be contaminated and over run with this irresistable
Plague, called the <i>Black Sickness</i>, I advise that with a tender hand
you speedily strike off his Head, and thereby rescue him from those
fatal ills which this mortal contagion most assuredly brings along with it.</p>

<p>And thus I think I have gone through the whole System of Cocking,
with as much plainness and brevity as might be, without omitting any
one particular that is necessary to be understood by the Ingenious Cock-Master.</p>

<span class="i0"><i>Before they Dy’d, to have their Winding sheet.</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Into the Pit they’re brought, and being there</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Upon the Stage, the</i> Norfolk <i>Canticleer</i></span>

<span class="i0"><i>More safe, by being fenced in with Blood.</i></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Swelling like Graves, as tho’ they did intend</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>T’intomb each other e’er the Quarrel end;</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But when the Wind is down, blustring Weather,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>They are made Friends, and sweetly run together;</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>May think these Champions such; their Blood grows low</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And they which leapt before, now scarce can go:</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Their Wings which lately at each blow they clapt,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>(As if they did applaud themselves) now flapt;</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And having lost th’ advantage of the Heel,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Drunk with each others Blood, they only reel;</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>From either Eyes such drops of Blood did fall,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>As if they wept them for their Funeral.</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And yet they fain would Fight; they came so near,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Methought they meant into each other’s Ear</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To whisper Wounds; and when they could not rise,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>They lay and lookt Blows int’ each others Eyes,</i></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Contracting, like a dying, Taper all</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>His strength, intending with the Blow to fall:</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He struggles up, and having taken Wind,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ventures a Blow, and strikes the other blind.</i></span>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
